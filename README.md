# Experiments

This is just a repository of experiments I'm working on. They may or may not
work or be useful.

The purpose is to be comfortable saving my ideas and not caring if they're ready
for others to use/browse or not. I believe that keeping ideas afloat without any
action is a recipe to never bring them to light. Furthermore, it's ok to have
flawed/buggy/half-baked things out there; there's no need to get stuck behind a
perfectionist trap.

## Inspiration

In addition to all the amazing projects out there, and people I've met that
build such projects, I'm primarily inspired by David Lynch.

## Structure

Each idea/experiment is placed in `packages`. The root of the repository just
sets up shared boilerplate and dev tooling. Each package has a number in front
so that they remain in order of when they first appeared.
